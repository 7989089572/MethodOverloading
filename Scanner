# Scanner Class in Java

## Theory

The **Scanner** class in Java (from `java.util` package) is used to get user input, and is commonly used to read various types of data (int, float, String, etc.) from the keyboard.

**Key Points:**
- Requires importing `java.util.Scanner`
- Used for reading input from various sources like keyboard, files, streams
- Common methods: `nextInt()`, `nextFloat()`, `next()`, `nextLine()`

**Basic Usage:**
1. Import Scanner: `import java.util.Scanner;`
2. Create a Scanner object: `Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);`
3. Read input: `int a = sc.nextInt();`

## Code Example

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = sc.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + ". You are " + age + " years old.");

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
